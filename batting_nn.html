		<title>PREDICTING POSITION FROM BATTING STATS WITH A NEURAL NETWORK</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Intro</h1>
		<p>MLB batting stats 2010-2016. Data from <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2017-standard-batting.shtml"
    target = "_self">Baseball-reference.com</a>. </p>
    <p>Players with less than 100 plate appearances were removed from the dataset. Pitchers and DHs were also removed. </p>
    <p>Using the toy neural network from <a href = "http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/"
    target = "_self">CS231n at Stanford</a>. I tracked training accuracy for the
		most likely overall prediction and the top three most likely predictions.</p>
		<p>Code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/jherzberg/batting_nn/blob/master/batting.py"
			target = "_self">here</a> for 8 class classification. </p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<h5>Training Loss (Blue) and Accuracy (Orange: Top 3 / Green: Overall) Plot</h5>
		<img src="https://github.com/jherzberg/jherzberg.github.io/top3.png" height="50%"/>

		<p>34% overall accuracy and 41% top 3 accuracy on test dataset.</p>

		<h2>Grouping</h2>
		<p>Given the ~1/3 accuracy, I grouped positions into three arbitrary groups: infield, outfield,
			and catcher. Obviously, top 3 accuracy is no longer relevant.</p>

		<h5>Training Loss (Blue) and Accuracy (Orange) Plot</h5>
		<img src="https://github.com/jherzberg/jherzberg.github.io/mappos.png" height="50%"/>

		<p>64.9% overall accuracy on test dataset. This is significant improvement over
		the initial 8-class classification, but suggests that the groups are not
		optimal or that grouping is not relevant to begin with. Further work should
		attempt clustering the data to explore.</p>
		<p>Given the many heuristics that fans would identify for mapping baseball positions
			to and from batting stats, i.e. "catchers cannot hit well", one expects significant predictability in this
			classification task. Our interns at <a href = "http://www.blocksixanalytics.com/"
	    target = "_self">Block Six Analytics</a> were only able to achieve 15% accuracy on this task. The neural network was
			able to significant outperform them at 34%.</p>

			<p>Special thanks to Holt Jones and Jack Claeys, the interns who attempted to beat the net.</p>
